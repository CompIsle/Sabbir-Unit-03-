                         I am 18 years old and interested in all types of Computing/IT sectors. I have also earned a qualification in Engineering (grade Distinction) and Motor Vehicle (grade Pass). I have done work experience at Stocks AG and this has given me experience on how the workplace is like and has helped me build more confidence as I now know what to expect when I get employed. In my spare time I enjoy going on walks or watching sports. My favourite sport is football and I sometimes watch it in my spare time. By going on walks this has helped me feel relaxed and calm which helps me to stay positive and healthy. I also help my dad in his restaurant on the weekends. I Help out by cleaning the tables and taking orders from customers. By doing this it has helped me gain more confidence and has improved my social skills which will help me in the future when dealing with customers or working together in the workplace. I have also gained a lot of experience on how working in a business feels like which will make me stand out from other applicants as I will have some experience.

                            I have created a website which sells phones, I have created this website with visual studio code which shows I am capable of creating websites using visual studio code.

Some of my additional skills I possess are I am patient and friendly when talking to customers/other people as I always use this skill when I am working as a waiter in my dad's restaurant. I am also able to problem solve and I can learn new skills quickly which may be useful in the future. I can deal with new surroundings very well and can adapt quickly which will help me work fast and to the best of my ability. I am very friendly and try not to leave anyone out as this will help me build good relationship with the other employees and help me be able to work with anyone which will be useful for group work etc. I have excellent computer skills and knowledge on how to use a computer which is very valuable when applying for most jobs as most jobs require the employee to be IT literate.( I have earned a qualification for word and powerpoint).

                            During my level 2 computing course, I have read the Barclays life skills for my virtual work experience. By reading the Barclays life skills this has helped me gain more knowledge on how a real work place feels like and what I should expect. These Barclays life skills have also improved on skills I already knew for example being respectful and customer service. After I completed the Barclays Life Skills work experience, I moved onto the games development virtual work experience which was mostly about the different roles of people when creating a game. (e.g. Designer, programmer, artist etc). I have completed the games development virtual work experience course which was on Future Learn. This course also covered the process on how to apply to jobs, how the work place feels, how to deal with problems at the workplace etc. By completing this course this has changed my perspective of the workpalce from being a place where no one wants to be to a place which is enjoyable and exciting to go there every day to work because you will be working with people who have the same passion as you. I have also gained an understanding on how games are developed and what the process is/how long a game takes to make. Overall this course has helped me understand how a business works and has prepared me to know what to expect when working in a business.
                            <p class="lead">Extra work experience I've completed:</p>

                            <h6 class="text-decoration-underline"><strong>Stocks AG (30 hours) 1/3/19 – 29/3/19</strong></h6>
                            During my Engineering course I have done work experience which was at Stocks AG. On the first day I was helping in the store room because a delivery had arrived and I helped sort out the delivery. Throughout my work experience I started to get the chance to do more advanced jobs e.g. welding and making turbo jets/rotary meters. This work experience has helped me build confidence by meeting and working with new people.
