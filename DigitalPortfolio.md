# Work Related/Work Experience:
During my level 2 computing course, I have read the Barclays life skills for my virtual work experience. By reading the Barclays life skills this has helped me gain more knowledge on how a real work place feels like and what I should expect. These Barclays life skills have also improved on skills I already knew for example being respectful and customer service. After I completed the Barclays Life Skills work experience I have completed the games development virtual work experience course. This course covered the process on how to apply to jobs, how the work place feels, how to deal with problems at the workplace etc. By completing this course this has improved my knowledge on how the workplace is really like. I have also gained knowledge on how games are developed and what the process is/how long a game takes to make. Overall this course has helped me gain more understanding on what the workplace experience is.

In my spare time I enjoy going on walks or watching sports. My favourite sport is football and I sometimes watch it in my spare time. By going on walks this has helped me feel relaxed and calm which helps me to stay positive and healthy. I also help my dad in his restaurant on the weekends. I Help out by cleaning the tables and taking orders from customers. By doing this it has helped me gain more confidence and has improved my social skills which will help me in the future when dealing with customers or working together in the workplace. I have also gained experience on how working feels like.
